[![Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/master/designs/thumbnail.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/master/designs/page.jpg)

### Instructions
For this challenge, you will need to build a simple webpage.

1) Open `code/index.html` and `code/index.css` in a text editor. The basic scaffolding of the page should already be in place.
2) Your task is to create the page shown in `designs/page.png` and `designs/page.psd`

### Notes
* If you need to copy and paste text content, you can find it all in [`copy.txt`](https://github.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/blob/master/copy.txt)
* Don't worry about being pixel perfect, but try to match the intent of the designs.
* Ignore browser compatibilityâ€”use whatever css techniques you think best accomplish the designs
* Image assets are already included [in this folder](https://github.com/qualialabs/fed-challenge/tree/master/code/images)
* A basic `container` element is included to speed up design and fonts have already been included

### Bonus Requirements

If you have extra time after completing the basic challenge you can also complete these additional tasks:

* Make the page responsive for tablet and mobile
* Add an interesting hover style for cards when they are moused over
